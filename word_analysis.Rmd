## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{Finding the Frequency of Adjectives}
#install.packages("SnowballC")
library(SnowballC)
  

parole_text_article_df %>%
  select(id) %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = id) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% #gets rid of stopwords and keeping words that don't match stopwordstolower() %>% 
  tolower() %>% #problem lowercase words
  #left-join to bring on part of speech to words
  #filter adjectives and the frequency of 
  #filter(pos, Adj)
  mutate(stem = wordStem(word)) %>%
  count(stem, sort = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
