```{Finding the Frequency of Adjectives}
library(SnowballC)
library(dplyr)
  

parole_sub %>%
  select(text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% #gets rid of stopwords and keeping words that don't match stopwords 
  tolower(text) %>% #problem lowercase words
  #left-join to bring on part of speech to words
  #filter adjectives and the frequency of 
  #filter(pos, Adj)
  mutate(stem = wordStem(word)) %>%
  count(stem, sort = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
